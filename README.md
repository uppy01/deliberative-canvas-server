## Deliberative Canvas Server

This repository provides a base configuration to sync and serve content for Deliberative Canvas apps...

It is based on Earthstar...

> "...a small and resilient distributed storage protocol designed with a strong focus on simplicity, and the social realities of peer-to-peer computing kept in mind."

> "An Earthstar server is an always-online peer which can synchronise with other Earthstar peers over the internet. It's also just a server, so it can handle requests from browsers and serve back responses, e.g. HTML pages made from data on your Earthstar shares."

See [here](https://earthstar-project.org/docs/server-guide) for the Earthstar server guide and [here](https://earthstar-project.org/tutorials/run-a-server) for a short tutorial on running a server.
- NOTE: this configuration is for the Deno runtime
